# Minesweeper
This is usual minesweeper game

It has the same rules. You must open all cells except cells with mines. If you open the mine, you will lose.
The first step always begins from an empty cell.
This game also has got a timer and you can compare your results with results of your friends.

There are 3 modes:
* 9x9 with 10 mines
* 16x16 with 40 mines
* 16x30 with 99 mines

You can also make a custom mode but it will not be added to results.

There is a registration system in my app, so you can create a local account.
